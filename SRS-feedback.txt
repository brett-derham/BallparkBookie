============================

This is a good start, a good effort that shows you guys are thinking about what
the overall project will do.  I like the CSCI breakdown structure, which reflects
good divisions for the project.  There are a few comments and some re-arrangement
that needs to be done, which costs you a point.

Here are the comments in the order I noticed them.

1) The 3rd paragraph of your overview should be re-written to be grammatically
   correct:

   If we get ahead of schedule there is more information we would like to provide
   to our user, such as projections of how individual players will do, or the
   probability that a selected team will make the playoffs.

2) You seem to have confused section 2 with section 3.  Section 2 provides the
   breakdown of the CSCI into CSC's and then into CSU's.  You have written it as
   the requirements themselves, with shall statements.  This is more appropriate
   for section 3.  Basically you can swap the two sections.

3) For section 3, when you make it into section 2, put the name of each of the
   sections at the start of each of those explanations.  This should give you
   excellent breakdown structure, along with good descriptions of each CSC and
   CSU in the project *in section 2*, then the functional requirements go on to
   flow out of that in section 3.

4) Make sure that when you have a "will" statement it starts on its own new line
   in the document.  For example, in 2.2.4 you have the will statement for the
   Big Predictions Page following right after the "shall" statement at the end
   of that line.  It should start a new [un-numbered] line directly under that
   requirement.

5) Remember that requirements are SINGLE STATEMENTS.  When you write a full
   paragraph, you are describing not specifying.  Keep each numbered requirement
   to a single sentence.  NEVER have the word "and" in a requirement since that
   indicates more than one requirement in a single statement.

Overall, this is nice work!  You guys have put thought into it, there's no doubt!

Make the changes listed above by the end of the semester for full credit on this assignment.

Initial submission 7% out of 8%, plus 2% out of 2% for the Gantt chart.
      9% out of 10% = 90% which is an A-minus
