Software Requirements Specification
CMSI 402 -- Ballpark Bookie Project
======================================

Very good work on this!

You've expressed the basics of the design well, and it is obvious you've put
a lot more thought into this.  I notice that you have combined the CSCI breakdown
part with the requirements part ~~ not standard, but OK for this exercise!

Just a couple of comments:
Try to make sure that throughout the document your descriptions are in the *present
tense* rather than in the *future tense*.  I know when you are writing the SRS it
"hasn't happened yet", but it WILL have happened by the time the project ends.  Try
to think in terms of "the project does" instead of "the project will do".  You can
also clean up the language to be a bit more parsimonious, but the future tense thing
is the real intent of this comment.  Here's one example:

IS:
2.1.5 Data Analysis : Once our data is normalized and compares, we will use machine
      learning regression function to compare the data we have normalized and 
      compared, with the list of wins of each team. This will return a score of 
      accuracy.

SHOULD BE:
2.1.5 Data Analysis : Once the data is normalized and compares, a machine learning
      regression function is used to compare the data with the list of wins of each
      team, and an accuracy score is returned.

I hope that makes it clear.

Otherwise, nice job!

Make those few minor changes by the end of the semester and you will have
full credit on this portion of the project.
