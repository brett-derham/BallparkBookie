Very nice work on this document!  You have captured the architectural details
quite nicely!  Just a couple of comments:

In your use-case diagram, remember that in *actual* UML, you would use a
rectangle for the system boundary instead of the ellipse you have.  You don't
need to change it unless you want to, but just be aware.

The "architectural" class diagram doesn't need the internals, just the outer
blocks of the classes.  However, since you have it done already, you won't
need to do another one for the detailed design.

Finally, the deployment diagram is NOT that....  this could be labeled with
something like "System Component Associations" and that way you can leave
the diagram as-is.

Otherwise, EXCELLENT work!

you got 10% out of 10% for this deliverable which is an A-plus.
