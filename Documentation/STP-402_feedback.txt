CMSI 402 -- Ballpark Bookie Project
======================================

Pretty minimal, but your project has so much in the background that it is
probably hard to figure out just what testing entails.

However, due to COVID-19 and the lateness in the semester, I'd rather you
were able to focus on completing a working project than updating documents.
With this in mind, here are some take-away lessons, listed as bullets:

+ the algorithm:
   - how do you verify the data is "clean"?  Is it manual?  If so say so.
   - how do you verify the algorithm is correct?  By inspection?
   - list some acceptance criteria that you will use to verify
+ the database:
   - what data goes in the database?  If any...
   - how do you know it got there?  Do you have a tool so you can check?
         lik PhpMyAdmin or something?
   - how do you test that you get proper data back out?  expected/actual?
+ data inputs from websites
   - how do you know that the data you get is really what is on there?
   - how do you verify that once it's clean it reflects the same values?
+ operation:
   - how many drop downs do you have?  Do you have a test for each one?
   - if one is selected, how do you know that the correct selection is
         made within the program or the algorithm?
+ error handling:
   - what error conditions do you detect?
   - do you have tests that simulate those errors?
   - does your code catch them?
   - does your code provide a meaningful message to the user for them?

Full credit for you on this assignment.
